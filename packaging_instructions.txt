Instructions to Package main.py to a macOS Application

1. Set Up a Fresh Environment
   - Navigate to your project directory:
     cd path/to/your/project
   - Create a virtual environment named 'myenv':
     python3 -m venv myenv
   - Activate the virtual environment:
     source myenv/bin/activate

2. Install Required Packages ( fresh install in new environment )
   - Install Flet, PyInstaller, and any other required packages:
     pip install flet pyinstaller pandas numpy matplotlib 

3. Package Your Application with Flet
   - Navigate to the directory where your main.py file is located:
     cd path/to/project/directory
   
   - Package your app: ## simple version
     flet pack main.py # to better customize the Application, skip this and follow next instruction

4. Customize the Application (Optional)
   - Customize the name, icon, and other details:
      # simply just run this complete command (have already set the icon path and names, but you can change name or product-name if you want)

     flet pack main.py --name MCSAgile --icon icon.png --product-name "Monte Carlo Simulation Agile Projects" --product-version "1.0.0" --file-description "Description"


5. Locate the Packaged Application
   - Your bundled Flet app should now be available in the dist folder:
     open dist/MCSAgile.app

6. Distribute the App
   - You can zip the contents of the dist folder and distribute it to your users.

Conclusion:
These instructions guide you through creating a virtual environment, installing necessary packages, and using Flet to package a Python script into a macOS application. Make sure to customize the commands according to your specific file paths and requirements.
